## Power Electronics in Real-time Systems for Education and Unified Solutions 

## 🔧 What is this project about?

This platform is built to support lab experiments and practical exercises for various university courses, including:

- Power Electronics
- Real-Time Control
- Converter Control Systems
- Circuit Design and Analysis

The board is designed with **modularity** and **flexibility** in mind, allowing users to test and interact with:

- **DC-DC converters** (e.g., Buck, Boost, Buck-Boost)
- **Motor control applications**
- **Closed-loop control systems**
- **Custom circuitry** in power electronics contexts

## ⚡ Key Features

- 🧩 **Modular Design** – Easily connect and swap power stages or control modules
- 📏 **Accessible Measurement Points** – Equipped with labeled test pins and signal flags
- 🧠 **STM32 MCU Compatibility** – Supports pluggable STM32-based control boards around the Nucleo32 Eval Board
- 🔌 **Multiple I/O Interfaces** – Rich set of analog/digital interfaces for sensors, actuators, and debugging
- 📚 **Education-First Approach** – Optimized for use in student labs and lecture demonstrations

## 🎯 Educational Goals

This project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, offering a hands-on platform where students can:

- Design and implement real-time controllers
- Analyze system behavior under various operating conditions
- Understand the interaction between hardware and software in embedded control systems
- Experiment with digital and analog control strategies in power electronics
